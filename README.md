# Rotations

## Modules

The rotations module contains two submodules:
- quaternions
- representations

### rotations.representations

Contains functions for transforming between rotation
representations.

### rotations.quaternions

Contains the Quaternion class and related transformations.

## Examples

Provided are examples of changing a rotation from one
representation to another in Examples.html, and outputing
a Rotation + Translation animation in Animation.html.

The examples can also be run interactively by running:
